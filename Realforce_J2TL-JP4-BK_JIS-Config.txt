Key remappings for my Realforce JIS keyboard.

Tool used to scan the keys (on Arch Linux) :
xorg-xev

Simply run the command "xev" to launch the tool.

Here's the code for each key on the last row of my keyboard :

Left Ctrl : 37
Super (Windows key) : 133
Left Alt : 64
Muhenkan (無変換) : 102
Space : 65
Henkan (変換) : 100
Kana (カタカナ) : 101
Alt Gr : 108
Fn : (No mapping)
Right Ctrl : 105

For remapping the keys, I used the tool xmodmap. On Arch Linux, it's known as : 
xorg-xmodmap

To get a list of the possible keys you can use for your remap, just just the command "xmodmap -pk".

Here's the remapping I did on my keyboard :

1. Muhenkan to Super key :
xmodmap -e "keycode 102 = Super_L"

2. Henkan to Alt Gr : 
xmodmap -e "keycode 100 = ISO_Level3_Shift"

For now, the Kana key hasn't been remapped as I find no utility to it. 
On my config, the Caps Lock has also been remapped to Ctrl for ease to use with Emacs (see other config file).
